If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message \"the letter is a vowel\" followed by the input.   \n","If the user enters y then your program should display a \"sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant\". \n","Otherwise your program should display a message indicating that the\n","letter is a consonant.\n","\n","### Dog Age\n","In this exercise you will write code that reads in a  dog's age in years from the user, use an appropriate prompt.
